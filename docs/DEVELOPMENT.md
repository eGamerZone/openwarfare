# Development

This document describes the process for running this application on your local computer.

## Getting started

This project is a Cod4 mod. Developer tools run on Windows environment.

You'll need `Call of Duty 4` game and `Mod tools` to compile the mod. Check the version in `package.json`.

Before installing the ModTools, we recommend making a `Call of Duty 4` game folder copy. It's preferable to have one version for playing and another for developing.

To install `Mod tools`, [download it from this repository](https://github.com/cod4mw/CoD4-Mod-Tools) and unzip the files to your "Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare" development directory.

You can find more information in the [Mod tools readme file](https://github.com/cod4mw/CoD4-Mod-Tools/blob/master/readme.txt).

Once you've installed it, open Terminal and run the following:

```cmd
.\makeMod.bat
```
